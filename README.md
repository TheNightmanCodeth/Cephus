Cephus
==============

Cepheus is prominently featured in the Perseus legend as 
the husband of lovely Cassiopeia and father of Princess Andromeda

What is this?
--------------

Cephus can activate Andromeda on-device for devices on Android 8.0+ 
who want to use Substratum themes. As of now, this app *requires root*
to work.  
  
I know to some this may seem counter-intuitive, since the main selling
point of andromeda is a rootless substratum setup. However, some users
are on a rooted Oreo and use Andromeda for certain themes that don't 
play nicely with Android 8+. 

Plans
--------------

Eventually, this *will* work on an unrooted device if I see enough people
requesting it. If you would like to see this support unrooted devices, 
go to the issues and comment on the issue for unrooted support. I will use
this as a gauge-of-interest.
